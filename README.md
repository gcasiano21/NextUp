# NextUp

## Description
**NextUp** is a community-driven web app developed as part of an **internship hackathon** to strengthen React and API development skills. The app allows internship members to share their favorite **TV shows, movies, books, and music** and discover recommendations from others.

On the home screen, users select a media type and receive a **random recommendation** from the pool of media submitted by other members. This makes it easy and fun for members to explore new media based on their peers’ favorites.

Currently, all data is stored on a firestore database.
